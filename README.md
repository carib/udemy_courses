### These are some of the Udemy courses I'm taking (or at least trying out). When I'm done with one, completed or otherwise, I'll add a summary and my thoughts in the directory README for that course. As always, feel free to email me with any questions or if you'd like to share thoughts about any of these: __yes@carib.codes__. Have fun!
