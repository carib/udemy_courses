You look around, unsure of where you are or how you might have arrived here.
You're in a cramped room filled with stacks of old newspaper. A putrid smell 
seems to be emanating from a wastebasket in the corner. There's an open door to your right.

What will you do?
1. Look in the wastebasket.
2. Go through the door.
