    The floor gives out below you. For a moment it''s just darkness and the wild textures
    of whatever was in that garbage wrestling around your body in motion. Suddenly
    a light appears and you roll out into an alley behind a dumpster. There''s a door
    floating in the air that says "YOU WIN"


    What do you want to do?

    1. Step through the door.

    2. Ignore good sense and reason and climb back up the dark smelly hole.'
