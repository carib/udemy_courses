  storyText: 'Walking down that corridor was not without its dangers. You nearly sprained
    your ankle a few times and once you thought you were in the clear a big glob of
    something that feels corrosive dripped down onto your shoulder from who knows
    what or where. You turn the corner and find stairs leading up to the next floor
    and a garbage chute overflowing with microwaveable burrito wrappers.


    What will you do?

    1. Climb the stairs.

    2. Climb into the garbage chute.'
