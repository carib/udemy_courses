  storyText: 'If not for a few stray patches of light, the hallway would be pitch
    black. Thankfully you can see a good distance down the length to your left. You
    can barely make out the misshapen fragments and forms of rubble from the ceiling
    collapse to your right. It sounds like a thin stream of water is leaking down
    from whatever lies above you.


    What will you do?

    1. Walk towards the light.

    2. Grope blindly at the rubble.'
